This section contains four parts.
%
Section~\ref{sec:insituinfrastructure} describes the in situ infrastructure for our approaches.
%
The next two sections describe the two Lagrangian flow map extraction approaches:
the traditional approach~(\ref{sec:baseline}) and a new communication-free approach~(\ref{sec:local}).
%
Section~\ref{sec:posthoc} describes how post hoc reconstruction, which applies to both approaches, is performed.
%
{Figures~\ref{fig:dist_1},~\ref{fig:dist_2},~\ref{fig:local_1}, and~\ref{fig:local_2} provide notional examples to compare both approaches.}
%
Further, based on the in situ system classification in~\cite{childs2020istp}, the Lagrangian flow map extraction system is classified as one with a dedicated API integration, on-node proximity, direct access, a time division of execution, automatic operation, and a derived output type.

\subsection{In Situ Infrastructure}
\label{sec:insituinfrastructure}
Our study used the Ascent in situ infrastructure~\cite{Larsen2017Ascent}.
%
The Ascent API can be used to integrate with a simulation code and access various in situ analytics capabilities.
%
It can also be used to create a workflow when loading data sets from disk.
%
The fundamental operation of particle advection required to compute the particle trajectories that form the Lagrangian flow map is implemented using the VTK-m library~\cite{moreland2016vtk}.
%
VTK-m is a platform-portable scientific visualization library for shared-memory parallel environments. 
%
This library enabled us to easily engage GPUs for particle advection.
%
Specifically, in situ particle advection is performed using fourth-order Runge-Kutta for interpolation.
%
Ascent has VTK-h~\cite{Larsen2017Ascent} as a distributed-memory wrapper around VTK-m.
%
VTK-h uses MPI and acts as the communication layer.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:insituinfrastructure} provides an illustration of the workflow for in situ data reduction.
%
Ascent is invoked every cycle of the simulation, and it consequently invoked the relevant calls to the Lagrangian \textit{filter} (VTK-h + VTK-m).
%
The rank-specific Lagrangian filter used the simulation vector field data to advect particles every cycle, and triggered the storage of trajectories that comprise the Lagrangian flow map. 
%
{Lagrangian analysis modules are available in the latest releases of the open-source Ascent~\cite{Larsen2017Ascent} and VTK-m~\cite{moreland2016vtk} libraries.}

\subsection{Traditional Computation of Lagrangian Flow Maps}
\label{sec:baseline}
Conceptually, a Lagrangian representation encodes the behavior of a time-varying flow using particle trajectories.
%
Given the early nature of investigations into the use of Lagrangian flow maps, the best ways to seed, represent in memory, communicate, and store flow maps are open questions. 
%
Section~\ref{sec:related} noted three prior sampling strategies; however, none of these were evaluated at scale.
%
As a baseline, our work implemented the technique described by Agranovsky et al.~\cite{agranovsky2014improved}
%
and is referred to as Lagrangian$_{Dist}$.

For Lagrangian$_{Dist}$, we defined the overall strategy for flow map computation by considering four aspects:
%
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Sampling:} For each data block, seeds are placed along a uniform grid. As particles are advected, they may diverge or cluster. 
%
To maintain domain coverage, particles are terminated after a fixed number of cycles, i.e., storage interval, and their end locations are saved, followed by a new set of particles uniformly seeded at the original starting locations.
%
Thus, sets of temporally non-overlapping particle trajectories are calculated that span the full duration of the simulation.
%
\item\textbf{In-memory Representation:} 
%
Adopting a minimal approach, only the current location and the validity of the particle are statically stored in memory. 
%
\item\textbf{Communication:} Ranks communicated every cycle to check for particles (incoming/outgoing) crossing rank boundaries to continue trajectory integration. 
%
Control is returned to the simulation after all communication is completed.
\item\textbf{Storage:} Agranovsky et al. did not specify how particles that exited the domain before the end of the storage interval are saved,
%
which is problematic for post hoc reconstruction. 
%
In our implementation, we stored the end location and a Boolean indicating validity, i.e., whether the particle remained within the domain for the entirety of the storage interval. 
%
\vspace{-1mm}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computation of Local Lagrangian Flow Maps}
\label{sec:local}
%
With this work, we propose an optimization to address the increasing cost of communication as the scale increases.
%
Our strategy is a simple, yet novel and scalable, approach: skip all the communication and compute only local Lagrangian flow maps in situ. 
%
We refer to this implementation as Lagrangian$_{Local}$ and define the overall strategy as follows:
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Sampling:} Similar to Lagrangian$_{Dist}$, we used a uniform seed placement and a fixed storage interval.
%
Additionally, seeds can be placed redundantly along domain boundaries in adjacent ranks, and although our study does not consider ghost zones, we believe these would serve to strengthen our proposed optimization.
%
\item\textbf{In-memory representation:} Similar to Lagrangian$_{Dist}$, we stored the current location and validity of a particle.
%
\item\textbf{Communication:} We eliminated all particle information exchange and synchronization. Particles that required communication to continue trajectory integration were discarded. Thus, all ranks operated independently.
%
\item\textbf{Storage:} For a uniform grid, we stored the end location (3 double) and validity (1 Boolean). Particles that were discarded were marked as invalid. 
%
\vspace{-1mm}
\end{itemize}

%
An interesting consideration was whether to store the particle termination time and boundary location.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:early_termination} illustrates the problem with this approach.
%
Three particle trajectories (P$_{1}$, P$_{2}$, P$_{3}$) start at time t$_{start}$.
%
Two of the particle trajectories (P$_{1}$, P$_{3}$) remain in their domain until t$_{end}$, i.e., for the entire storage interval, and one particle (P$_{2}$) reaches the domain boundary at t$_{int}$.
%
During post hoc reconstruction, using the information of P$_{2}$ to transport a new particle from t$_{start}$ to t$_{int}$ requires knowing the location of neighboring particles (P$_{1}$, P$_{3}$) at t$_{int}$.
%
Only the particle start and end locations are known in our case, so this approach would require linearly interpolating (depicted using the dotted brown line) the locations of the neighboring particles at t$_{int}$.
%
However, these interpolated locations are often erroneous (orange particles).
%

The benefits of computing local Lagrangian flow maps are reduced execution time and improved scalability characteristics. 
%
Further, for storage intervals that are used in practice, we hypothesize only a small percentage of particles will be discarded.
%
However, the loss of information in the form of discarded particle trajectories could reduce the quality of flow reconstruction.
%
Our study evaluates this trade-off.
%
Lastly, we believe this performance optimization could be applied adaptively, i.e., communication can be turned on/off when appropriate.
%
Our study assumed an ``always off'' approach, which we view as invaluable for future adaptive designs.

\subsection{Post Hoc Flow Field Reconstruction}
\label{sec:posthoc}
We used a Lagrangian-based advection scheme similar to prior work~\cite{agranovsky2014improved, bujack2015lagrangian}.
%
New particles interpolate temporally nonoverlapping sets of particle trajectories.
%
For a specific storage interval, the starting positions of all valid trajectories are treated as points in an unstructured mesh.
%
To calculate the trajectory of a particle $P$, the \textit{neighborhood}, i.e., the containing cell of the unstructured mesh, is first identified.
%
We computed the cells of the unstructured mesh by performing Delaunay triangulation.
%
The identified neighborhood forms a convex hull around the particle $P$.
%
Next, $P$ ``follows'' the neighborhood until the end of the specific storage interval.
%
To compute the next location of $P$, we used the end locations of the neighborhood particles and barycentric coordinate interpolation.
%
This process can continue for several steps, with each advection step advancing the particle forward in time by the length of the storage interval.
