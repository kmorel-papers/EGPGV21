While the major focus of this work is scalability and the use of local Lagrangian flow maps, the benefits come with certain limitations as shown in our quantitative evaluation.
%
First, as observed for the Jet data set, a vector field with very high velocity might be poorly reconstructed.
%
%In particular, we observe this for the Jet data set.
%
Second, our evaluation as well as prior works have demonstrated that Lagrangian$_{Dist}$ can provide high accuracy while using a small number of samples, i.e., providing a significant data reduction (for example, 1:64 data reduction factor corresponds to a $>$~98\% compression of time-varying vector data).
%
The Lagrangian$_{Local}$ strategy leverages this knowledge and discards particle trajectories in order to remain communication-free.
%
However, this choice then limits the degree of data reduction.
%
While both Lagrangian$_{Dist}$ and Lagrangian$_{Local}$ show error (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:strongscaling}, the error of Lagrangian$_{Local}$ increases faster when using a small number of samples or large storage intervals.
%

We briefly discuss two solutions to these challenges.
%
The first solution involves the adoption of some communication with spatially adjacent ranks every cycle.
%
Such a technique can be triggered if high velocity regions are detected.
%For example, the Los Alamos National Laboratory MPAS-O uses an integrated online Lagrangian analysis system that uses a combination of frequent local communication and infrequent global communication to perform particle exchange operations~\cite{VANSEBILLE201849}.
%
%However, we are unaware of technical details or a study of this system and expect its performance would be dependent on the specific application (underlying vector field), domain decomposition, rank placement, and synchronization.
%
The second solution involves Lagrangian analysis remaining communication-free while adopting a more complex strategy for domain coverage with particle termination information (location, time) stored.
%
A flow map with arbitrary termination times for particle trajectories, however, would require a novel post hoc interpolation scheme.
%
We believe the aforementioned limitations can be addressed via these solutions.
