\caption{{Execution time per step of Lagrangian$_{Dist}$ and Lagrangian$_{Local}$ grouped by data set and ordered by the number of particles for \textbf{Phase-II} experiments. Overall, most Lagrangian$_{Local}$ tests required under 0.005 seconds per step and showed small variance. In contrast, Lagrangian$_{Dist}$ tests showed higher cost per step as well as more variability.}}
