In this example, the flow maps consist of particles \{$x_0$, $x_1$, $x_2$\} and \{$x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$\} for the intervals [$t_0$, $t_1$] and [$t_1$,$t_2$], respectively. The flow maps are used as input during the post hoc phase. Here, the trajectory of particle $p_0$ is calculated by interpolating the flow maps over two intervals of time.}}
