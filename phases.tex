\caption{\fix{The phases of Lagrangian analysis. The in situ phase uses uniform seed placement and extracts flow maps over temporally nonoverlapping intervals. In this example, the flow map for the interval [$t_0$, $t_1$] consists of particles \{$x_0$, $x_1$, $x_2$\} and the flow map for the interval [$t_1$, $t_2$] consists of particles \{$x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$\}. The extracted flow maps are used as input during the post hoc phase. Here, the trajectory of particle $p_0$ is calculated by interpolating the flow maps extracted over two intervals of time, i.e., from $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the first time interval and $x_3$ and $x_4$ in the second time interval.}}
