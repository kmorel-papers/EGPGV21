\caption{\fix{The phases of Lagrangian analysis. The in situ phase involves extracting flow maps using uniform seed placement and temporally non-overlapping intervals. The extracted flow maps are used as input during the post hoc phase. In this example, the trajectory of a particle (red) is calculated by interpolating the flow maps over two intervals of time.}}
